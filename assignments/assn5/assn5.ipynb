        "> The intuition behind this metric is that, if a model assigns a high probability to a test set, it is not surprised to see it (not perplexed by it), which means the model $M$ has a good understanding of how the language works. Hence, a good model has, in theory, a lower perplexity. The exponent $(-1/N)$ in the formula is just a normalizing strategy (geometric average), because adding more characters to a test set would otherwise introduce more uncertainty (i.e. larger test sets would have lower probability). So by introducing the geometric average, we have a metric that is independent of the size of the test set.\n",

        "  The GRU model, however, was only trained for 10 epochs. Its samples contain many repeated characters and incomplete or nonsense words, and the sentences tend to degrade more quickly.

The observed differences are therefore a combination of **model capacity** (GRU vs RNN) and **training budget** (number of epochs).\n"

The first step in processing this text is to turn it into a vector representation. This is done via a learned embedding look-up table. For each token in the vocabulary $t \\in \\mathcal{V}$, we learn an embedding $E_t \\in \\reals^d$. A sequence of tokens $(t_1, ..., t_n)$ is transformed to a vector representation by mapping each token to its embedding $(E_{t_1}, ..., E_{t_n}) \\in \\reals^{n \\times d}$.

        "Transformer models are by-default permutation-equivariant. That is, they don't understand order or position. To make them understand positional information, we need to encode it directly in the token embeddings. One way to do this is to represent each possible position $i$ with its own position embedding ${PE}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and to simpthe positional embedding representing the position of the token.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the original Transformer paper, the authors propose a particular choice for ${PE}_i \\in \\reals^{d}$ based on sines and cosines with frequencies depending on the position $i$. Since the original proposal, many follow-up works proposed different positional encoding methods aiming to improve performance and length-generalization. In this problem, we'll use the sinusoidal positional encodings of the original Transformer paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "We provide the code for computing these sinusoidal positional embeddings below. To give some intuition about the structure of the sinusoidal positional embeddings, we also plot a heatmap of the pairwise inner products $\\langle PE_i, PE_j \\rangle$. We see that that positions that are closer together have more similar positional embeddings, with additional oscillatory behavior on top of that."

        "The core operation in a Transformer is multi-head attention, sometimes called self-attention. In this problem, we will implement multi-head attention in numpy from scratch, given the trained parameters of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The input is a sequence of vectors $X = (x_1, ..., x_n) \\in \\reals^{n \\times d_{model}}$. For each attention head $h \\in [n_h]$, the parameters consist of a query projection matrix $W_q^h \\in \\reals^{d_{model} \\times d_h}$, a key projection matrix $W_k^h \\in \\reals^{d_{model} \\times d_h}$, and a value projection matrix $W_k^h \\in \\reals^{d_{model} \\times d_h}$. Here, $d_h$ is the \"head dimension\", taken to be $d_{model} / n_h$ (to maintain the same dimensionality between the input and output). The algorithm, for each head, is the following:\n",
        "1. Compute the queries $Q = X W_q^h$, keys $K = X W_k^h$, and values $V = X W_v^h$. Note that the linear maps are applied independently for each token across the embedding dimension (not sequence dimension), such that $Q, K, V \\in \\reals^{n \\times d_h}$.\n",
        "2. Compare the queries and keys via inner products to get an $n \\times n$ attention matrix $A = \\mathrm{Softmax}(Q K^{\\intercal}) \\in \\reals^{n \\times n}$.\n",
        "3. Use the attention scores $A$ to select values, producing the output of the self-attention head: $\\mathrm{head}_h = A V \\in \\reals^{n \\times d_h}$.\n",
        "We then concatenate the retrieved values across all heads, and apply a final linear map. Putting this all together yields:\n",
